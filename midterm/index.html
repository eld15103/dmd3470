                    <small>The History & Origin</small>
                </h1>
                <p>Dark mode tends to go by a few names: black mode, dark theme, night mode, light-on-dark. Dark mode is a theme you could set your browser to. This theme could also be set to certain smartphone applications like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Discord, and many more. All of these have helped boost the popularity of this "custom" theme.</p>
                <p>With that information in mind, you can test it out with the button above. This theme allows for a user's interface (smartphone, laptop, etc) to display a light colored text over a dark or black screen. This being the opposite of light mode, which is the default of all browsers and applications. It's much more familiar and displays a bright white background and dark texts.</p>
                <p>The idea of dark mode is to reduce the amount of light that devices emitt, while still making it easy for people to read on with a bold enough color contrast. This setting is accessible on both iPhone and Android devices, where you can have a system-wide default. However, not all apps allow that default, and if you are driven enough, you can individually change the themes within the applications themselves.</p>
                <b class="p-ind-1">What are the general characteristics of dark mode? It overall could be identified by:</b>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - Light on dark design dynamic</p>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - Inverted color scheme and often having greyscale fonts</p>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - A lot of negative space</p>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - Neutral colors</p>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - Softer color hues and tones</p>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - Stark contrast between fore ground and background</p>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - Dramatic overtones</p>
                <p class="p-ind-2"> - Energy conservation</p>
                <p> Now that we know what it is and how we could recognized it, what is the history behind it? Stemming from the 1980's, where computer users were forced into dark mode. The screens were black and nothing else, with contrasting typography fonts in white or green. Computers were only ever in dark mode, this being their default display. Then how did we get to the default display we see now? White backgrounds with dark texts were actually a way to create a feeling similar to black ink on paper.</p>
                <p> We have started using dark/night mode more often within the last few years for a few reasons. People saw it as something new and edgy aesthetic, while others heard of it's benefits - battery saving and it being better on the eyes.

                </h3>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>First, you need to makesure that your style.css file is attached to your html head.</p>
                <p> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"></p>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Next, you need to add the JavaScript into the head section as well in a script.</p>
                <p> script type="text/javascript"> document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) { 
                <p> document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", "dark"); }); /script> </p>

                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Adding the CSS is fairly simple. Especially if you follow along to the tutorial! Start with the following code to set a defualt light theme.</p>
                <p>:root {
                    --background-color: #fff;
                    --text-color: #000;
                  }</p>
                <p>
                    [data-theme="dark"] {
                        --background-color: #3F3F3F;
                        --text-color: #fff;
                      }
                </p>
                <p>
                    body {
                        background-color: var(--background-color);
                        color: var(--text-color);
                      }

                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>Replace the old JavaScript code in the head section with the following:</p>
                <p>script type="text/javascript"> document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) { 
                    <p> document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", "dark"); }); </p>

                </h1>
                <p >You thought dark mode was good for your eyes right? Well, not really. Though you might think dark mode is better for you -especially with that being the objective with that theme- it really isn't all that great for you. Overall, dark mode is the ideal setting in dimly lit conditions. It may be easy for a lot people to read, but it's much harder for people who have astigmatisms. According to the American Optometric Association, 30% of people have a form of this condition. Astigmatisms affect focus and makes it more difficult for people to read light text on dark backgrounds.</p>
                <p>The idea of dark mode is to reduce the amount of light that devices emitt, while still making it easy for people to read on with a bold enough color contrast. This setting is accessible on both iPhone and Android devices, where you can have a system-wide default. However, not all apps allow that default, and if you are driven enough, you can individually change the themes within the applications themselves.</p>

						<h3 id="aesthetic">The Aesthetic</h3>
						<p>What is the aesthetic of dark mode? For a lot of people, it's the drastic change between what they normally see and how piercing it can be on the eyes. An appeal could be that it can be used both during the day and night time. Dark mode has been an aesthtic for all ages because of this darker color scheme that allows sufficient color contrast regardless to the background's appearance. Using these dark colors allows for a great contrast between foreground and background for those looking at this display setting.</p>
                        <p>Overall, dark mode has become this aesthetic trend that applications and users of all devices can embrace. Twitter has been one of the latest applications trying to convert their platform to have a dark mode interface for its users. This will always come down to the personal preference though. A lot of the time, users who gravitate to the dark mode feature are usually night crawlers. They tend to rely on the night mode setting to give their eyes a small bit to recuperate from bright screens. Besides the night crawlers, the shade of black used in dark mode allows viewers to experience more vivid and dynamic colors. But of course, the aesthetic of dark mode is based on who you ask and what they benefit from it. </p>
                        <p> How many people do you know that have dark/night mode theme set on their devices? </p>

						<h3>The Benefits</h3>
						<p>It may feel like now after reading all the negatives of dark mode, you may feel that there's nothing good about. Which is far from the truth. Some benefits include: </p>
                        <p class="p-ind-3"> - It helps save battery life. Devices with OLED and AMOLED displays are unique from older displays. With every individual pixel lit with an all-white-background, it drains batteries faster.</p>
                        <p class="p-ind-3"> - Reduces screen glare and blue light exposure. Blue light is a high-energy visible light spectrum with the shortest wavelength. The biggest natural source of blue light for human beings is the Sun, but our phones emit trace amounts of blue light, too. Blue light has been known to disrupt natural sleep patterns!</p>
                        <p class="p-ind-3"> - Makes it easier on your eyes when looking at a screen in a dark room</p>
                        <p class="p-ind-3"> - It makes anything on your interface more dramatic and colorful content more dynamic</p>
                        <p class="p-ind-3"> - It's able to create soothing emotion for its users, while optimizing the feeling of luxury on any devices that it's on</p>
